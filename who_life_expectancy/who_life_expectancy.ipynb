    "# Introduction/Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will go over the World Health Organization Life Expectancy dataset. This dataset can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). We are given data on a country, population, health issues, life expectancy, etc. Our goal would be to create a model that can accurately determine the life expectency given a some characteristics on a population. Throughout this notebook I will visualize the data, explain some data preprocessing techniques, construct and evaluate models and analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration & Preprocessing:\n",
    "I will go over the dataset, analyzing its various features, checking for missing values, and gaining insights into the distribution of variables. Prior to building the models, I will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure good model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Building & Evaluation:\n",
    "In this notebook I will try implement a couple of models to try and see which ones are more accurate at predicting life expectancy. This is a supervised learning task since we are given the life expectancy of these population. Additionally this is a regression tasks because we are trying to predict a numerical value rather then put something into a category. For this notebook the models I chose is multiple linear regression, polynomial regression and a neural network. Lastly I will interpret the results of each model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Finally, I will be discussing potential areas for model improvement, what stood out to me and what were some challanges.. The conclusion serves more as a reflection for me on my time working on this notebook. This will serve as a good test for me to keep learning and testing my skills. "

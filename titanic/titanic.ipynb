    "# Introduction/Project Overview:\n",
    "In this notebook, I will present my solution and analysis of the Titanic dataset. This is a very famous dataset that can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains demographics of the Titanc passengers, incluiding who survived and who did not. The goal is to build a model that can correctly classify new examples (check who will survive or not). Throughout this notebook I will visualize the data, explain some data preprocessing techniques, construct and evaluate models and analyze the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Exploration & Preprocessing:  \n",
    "I will conduct a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, analyzing its various features, checking for missing values, and gaining insights into the distribution of variables. Prior to building the models, I will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure optimal model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Building & Evaluation:\n",
    "In this notebook I will try implement several models to try and correctly classify passengers who survied. This is a supervised learning task as we are given the labels of who survived and who did not. For this project the models I have chosen are logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. For each of these modules I will evalute their peformance using f1score, confusion matrices, and overall accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion: \n",
    "Finally, I will interpret the results of the models, identifying significant factors that contribute to passenger survival prediction and discussing potential areas for model improvement. The Titanic dataset is a good challange to test your knowledege on machine learning. This will serve as a good test for me to keep learning and testing my skills."

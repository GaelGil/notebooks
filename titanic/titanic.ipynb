    "# Introduction/Project Overview:\n",
    "In this notebook, I will present my solution and analysis of the Titanic dataset. This is a very famous dataset that can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains demographics of the Titanc passengers, incluiding who survived and who did not. The goal is to build a model that can correctly classify new examples (check who will survive or not). Throughout this notebook I will visualize the data, explain some data preprocessing techniques, construct and evaluate models and analyze the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Exploration & Preprocessing:  \n",
    "I will go over the dataset, analyzing its various features, checking for missing values, and gaining insights into the distribution of variables. Prior to building the models, I will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure good model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Building & Evaluation:\n",
    "In this notebook I will try implement several models to try and correctly classify passengers who survied. This is a supervised learning task as we are given the labels of who survived and who did not. For this project the models I have chosen are random forests and support vector machines. For each of these modules I will evalute their peformance using confusion matrices and training accuracy. I choose to leave out logistic regression, decision trees and naive bayes because I choose to leave out logistic regression because of its assumption of linearity. Because I dont think there is a linear relationship between our features and labels, that would really limit logistic regression. Decision trees because I just think random forests would peform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion: \n",
    "Finally, I will interpret the results of the models, identifying significant factors that contribute to passenger survival prediction and discussing potential areas for model improvement. The Titanic dataset is a good challange to test your knowledege on machine learning. This will serve as a good test for me to keep learning and testing my skills. The submission will be posted on kaggle to get a score."

Lets move on and get some information on the numerical columns that we have. "

    "We can see that the average `Age` of people that did not survive was `30.6` while the average `Age` of those who did was `28.34`. Although not a huge difference it makes sense that people who survived are younger as they prioritized women and children in case of emergencies. Additionally a intersting relationship here is `Fare`. For those who did not survive their average `Fare` was `22.11` while those who did survive was `48.39`. This could mean that those who payed larger ammounts of money for their fare came from wealthy families and had priority. This tells us that `Fare` could be an important feature. "

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "So ideally I would have checked the data in the `test.csv` to see that the labels are missing. Using the training set to evaluate is not really a good measurement. However seeing that it did not get a .99 on the accuracy might be a good thing because we know its not overfitting. To confirm this we could use the test if we had the labels. Some future improvments things for next time are to check both training and test set. So in the end this notebook serves more as a pandas excercise to get use to using all its features and was really helpful honestly. Additionally I got 0.77751 on kaggle for accuracy so not a terrible experiment.  "

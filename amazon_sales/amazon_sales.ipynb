    "# Introduction/Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will present my solution and analysis of the Titanic dataset. This is a very famous dataset that can be found on kaggle. The dataset contains demographics of the Titanc passengers, incluiding who survived and who did not. The goal is to build a model that can correctly classify new examples (check who will survive or not). Throughout this notebook I will visualize the data, explain some data preprocessing techniques, construct and evaluate models and analyze the results.\n",
    "Data Exploration & Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "I will go over the dataset, analyzing its various features, checking for missing values, and gaining insights into the distribution of variables. Prior to building the models, I will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure good model performance.\n",
    "Model Building & Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will try implement several models to try and correctly classify passengers who survied. This is a supervised learning task as we are given the labels of who survived and who did not. For this project the models I chose is random forests. Ideally I would test several to see which one performs best but to keep this simple as a practice example I will just use one model.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I will interpret the results of the models, identifying significant factors that contribute to passenger survival prediction and discussing potential areas for model improvement. The Titanic dataset is a good challange to test your knowledege on machine learning. This will serve as a good test for me to keep learning and testing my skills. The submission will be posted on kaggle to get a score.\n"

    "In this notebook I will go over generative adversarial networks also known as gans. I will briefly explain their history, model architechture and the math behind them. This notebook will cover the standar gan, proggresive growing of gans, and stylegan. I have used these vidoes here as guides and inspiration for this project. [video]() . This notebook will mainly be markdown but the code will be in the src folder in this repo."

    "## Generative Adversarial Networks \n",
    "A generative adversarial network (aka GAN) is a model that generates new data that is similar to its training data. As the name implies in this neural network architechture there are two networks competing with each other. We have the `generator` which is responsible for generating data similar to the training data and the `discriminator` whos goal is to goal is to correctly classify real data. The idea of GANs is to train the generator to be generate new examples of data so similar to its training examples that the discrimiantor classifies them as real data. Initially we start with random noise and through each iteration the generator learns to generate real looking data. Some use cases of this are generating new data, merging images, generating high resolution images from low ones, and generating audio. Lets go over our first gan!!!"

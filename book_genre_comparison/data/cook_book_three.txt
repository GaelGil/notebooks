The New Royal Cook Book

The new Royal Cook Book has been prepared to meet the large and ever increasing demand for a guide to wholesome and palatable home cooking. The young housewife will find here complete simple directions for making delicious cakes and other culinary delights. Experienced cooks and those more skilled in the art will find here many of their favorite recipes and in addition helpful suggestions, especially in the matter of saving eggs and other expensive materials.

Every recipe has been tested many times and all have been found excellent.

Royal Baking Powder is used in all recipes in which a leavening agent is required, and the biscuits, muffins, griddle cakes, doughnuts, cakes and pastry prepared by its use are unequalled in texture and healthfulness. "Royal" imparts a fine appearance, and a particularly good flavor to the food.

Housekeepers are urged to avoid substitutes for Royal Baking Powder. Failures in baking often result from the use of sour milk and soda, or even home made mixtures of cream of tartar and soda, because of inability to determine the uncertain strength of such materials and hence the proper proportions to use.

Avoid all guess work by using "Royal." It is always the same, always dependable.

SOME SECRETS OF GOOD COOKING
The addition of one or two teaspoons of Royal Baking Powder to plain pastry will add wonderfully to its qualities, making it very light and tender.

Omelets are improved by the addition of a small amount of Royal Baking Powder.

Royal Baking Powder may be added with great advantage to bread pudding, poultry dressing, stuffed or deviled crabs and other preparations in which broken bread or bread crumbs are used.

Icings and especially Ornamental Icings are improved in texture and flavor by the addition of about a teaspoon of Royal Baking Powder.

Instead of adding soda to keep color in green vegetables use Royal Baking Powder.

[Pg 1]

Royal Baking Powder
For raising or leavening breads, biscuits, rolls, muffins, griddle cakes, doughnuts, cakes, pastries, puddings and other similar foods.


Absolutely Pure and Wholesome

The principal active ingredient of Royal Baking Powder is Royal Grape Cream of Tartar, a derivative of rich, ripe grapes. It perfectly aerates and leavens the batter or dough and makes the food finer in appearance, more delicious to the taste, and more healthful.

It possesses the greatest practicable leavening strength, never varies in quality, and will keep fresh and perfect in all climates until used.


The Standard for over 50 Years

For over 50 years Royal Baking Powder has been the standard. Most of the famous baking recipes in use today were created with it. Most of the famous cooking schools use it. Housewives all over the world have followed the lead of the American housewife and insist upon it. "I must have La Royal," say our Spanish-speaking neighbors in Mexico, Cuba and South America. "I want Royal Baking Powder and no other," say housewives in England, Scotland and Ireland.

Only unequalled quality could create such a world-wide demand.


Used in Leading Hotels

Prominent chefs and expert bakers in America, including those of the famous restaurants in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and other cities, consider Royal Baking Powder the most reliable, most efficient and the most dependable leavening agent.

Physicians recommend Royal Baking Powder for its wholesomeness and for the healthful qualities that it adds to the food.

For Making the Finest and Most Healthful Food, Royal Baking Powder is Indispensable.

[Pg 2]

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS
Where shortening is mentioned in the recipes it is understood that butter or lard, or an equivalent quantity of butter substitute or vegetable oil may be used.

MEASUREMENTS
All measurements for all materials called for in the recipes in this book are level.

The standard measuring cup holds one-half pint and is divided into fourths and thirds.

To make level measurements fill cup or spoon and scrape off excess with back of knife.

One-half spoon is measured lengthwise of spoon.

Sift flour before measuring.

BAKING
Regulate the oven carefully before mixing the ingredients. Many a cake otherwise perfectly prepared is spoiled because the oven is too hot or not hot enough.

Biscuits and pastry require a hot oven; cakes, a moderate oven.

When a cake is thoroughly baked it shrinks from the sides of the pan. A light touch with the finger which leaves no mark is another indication that the cake is baked.

TABLE OF EQUIVALENT WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
1	saltspoon	=	1/4 teaspoon
3	teaspoons	=	1 tablespoon
16	tablespoons	=	1 cup

2	cups butter	=	1 pound
2	tablespoons butter	=	1 ounce
2	tablespoons liquid	=	1 ounce
4	tablespoons flour	=	1 ounce
1	square unsweetened chocolate	=	1 ounce
All measurements are level. Four level teaspoons of baking powder about equal one heaping teaspoon as heretofore used.

Bread and Rolls
Royal Baking Powder may be used instead of yeast to leaven bread. It does the same work; that is, raises the dough, making it porous and spongy.

The great advantage in baking powder bread is in time saved. Royal Baking Powder bread can be mixed and baked in about an hour and a half.

Royal Baking Powder Bread
4 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
7 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder
1 medium-sized, cold boiled potato

Pastry and Pies
A pinch of salt and a little Royal Baking Powder make pastry light, flaky and more digestible.

Pastry should rise in baking to double its thickness, and be in light flaky layers. The novice must learn to handle it lightly and as little as possible in rolling and turning. It is important to have all materials and utensils cold.

Pastry is better if allowed to stand in the icebox several hours before using.

Meats
Roasting
Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie into shape if necessary. Put some pieces of fat in bottom of pan, and season meat with salt and pepper. Have oven very hot at first and when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste every 10 to 15 minutes. If there is danger of fat in pan being scorched add a little boiling water. Roast from 10 to 15 minutes for each pound of meat, as it is desired rare or well done.

Broiling
The rules for roasting meat apply to broiling, except that instead of cooking it in the oven it is to be quickly browned, first on one side and then on the other, over hot coals or directly under a gas flame, turning every minute until done. Meat an inch and one-half thick will broil in 8 to 15 minutes. Season after it is cooked.

Pan Broiling or Frying
Put meat to be broiled or fried in very hot frying pan, with very little or no fat. Turn every few minutes until cooked. Season and serve immediately. Steaks and chops may be pan-broiled without any fat in the pan. For thin gravy pour a little boiling water into pan after meat is taken out.

Boiling and Stewing
Fresh meat for boiling should be put into boiling water and boiled hard for about 5 minutes; reduce heat and boil gently about 20 minutes for each pound, salt and spices may be added for seasoning. A little vinegar put into the water with tough meat makes it tender. The broth of boiled meat should always be saved for soups, stews or gravies. Salt meats should be put in cold water, which as soon as it boils should be replaced by fresh cold water, repeating if necessary until meat has palatable flavor when done. Salted and smoked meats require about 30 minutes slow boiling, to each pound. Vegetables and herbs may be boiled with them to flavor. When cooked keep hot until required, if they are to be served hot; if they are to be served cold, cool in liquor in which they were boiled. Very salt meats, or those much dried in smoking, should be soaked over night in cold water.

Pot Roasting
Tough cuts of meat may be first browned in fat, then half covered with boiling water and cooked slowly either in oven or in iron kettle on top of stove. This method requires long, slow cooking.

Beverages
How to Make Coffee
The best method of making coffee, as determined by the Better Coffee-Making Committee of the National Association of Coffee Roasters, is as follows:

"Fill a kettle with fresh cold water and put it on to boil. Place over an open china teapot, kept just for coffee, a clean, wet, old linen napkin, or a new square of unbleached muslin, letting it sag toward the center. Put into the depression 4 heaping tablespoons (for 4 cups of coffee) of finely pulverized coffee. This fine pulverization is very important. Ordinary ground coffee will not do at all, and gives weak infusions.

"When the water in the kettle is boiling fiercely, pour it through the coffee slowly until 4 cups have gone through, or a trifle more for 4 cups of coffee.

"Cover and take at once to table.

"Wash the cloth immediately and keep it in a jar of cold water, never permitting it to get dry, and freshening the water every day. Keeping the cloth sweet is essential. Every effort should be made to this end. The least souring ruins the coffee.

"Follow these directions strictly, paying especial attention to having the coffee very fine, like flour, and the water boiling, and you will have excellent coffee even though you buy cheap blends."

Boiled Coffee
For 4 cups. Beat half an egg white with 3 tablespoons cold water; add 3/4 cup ground coffee and stir until moistened; put into scalded coffee pot; add 1 quart boiling water and boil 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup cold water and allow to stand 3 minutes to settle and serve.

Cocoa
The usual rule is 2 teaspoons cocoa, 1 teaspoon sugar; 1 tablespoon cold water and 3/4 cup milk to each cup. Mix cocoa with sugar and cold water; cook over slow fire until thick; add milk, and boil 1 minute.

Cocoa Syrup
2 cups water
2 cups sugar
1 cup cocoa
1/2 teaspoon salt
Stir water and sugar in saucepan until dissolved; boil 5 minutes; mix cocoa with cold water to make a paste and add to boiling syrup; boil slowly for 10 minutes; add salt. When cold put into bottle or glass jar in refrigerator. Take 2 tablespoons of syrup for each glass or cup of milk. Serve with whipped cream.

Served either hot or iced, this is a nourishing and delicious beverage.

[Pg 43]

Take from fire when very light brown, as they continue to color after removing from pan. Drain well on brown paper and sprinkle with salt.

Fireless Cookery
The Fireless Cooker has become an important factor in the home. The principle employed is the preservation of heat by the use of non-conducting materials. The device ordinarily used is a rectangular box lined on all sides with some substance which will prevent escape of heat, with spaces or wells for the insertion of stone or metal discs or radiators and vessels containing food to be cooked.

Among the advantages of this method are: the improvement in flavor by slower cooking with little opportunity for evaporation; improved appearance of food that is subject to shrinkage when cooked by ordinary methods; saving in labor, as the cooking practically takes care of itself. Dinner may be prepared in the morning, placed in the cooker, and without further attention be ready to serve at any time after 3 or 4 hours. While the time required for cooking is longer than in the usual methods, the actual time consumed in preparation of a meal is considerably reduced.

[Pg 45]

DIRECTIONS
Prepare food for cooking as usual. Place in special vessel, designed to fit into wells of Fireless Cooker, and heat on range or over gas flame until ordinary cooking temperature is reached. Put into cooker with one or more radiators which have been heated for 10 or 15 minutes over hot fire. For roasting, radiator should be hot enough to brown a pinch of flour immediately. Close cover, fasten lightly so that the steam may escape and allow cooking to proceed for time specified in recipes.

For baking cake, apples, etc., proceed as for roasting. The time required for baking is slightly longer than that specified for regular ovens. For cake ordinarily baked in a moderate oven, heat radiators hot enough to brown a pinch of flour in half a minute.

The Fireless Cooker is especially convenient for the preparation of cereals, meats, vegetables and other dishes that are ordinarily boiled or roasted. Remember that foods should be thoroughly heated before putting into cooker.

Cereals
Prepare cereal for cooking in double boiler as usual. Boil over fire for 5 minutes; place in larger vessel of boiling water in cooker and allow it to remain 4 or 5 hours or longer. If placed in cooker at night it should remain warm enough to serve for breakfast.

Steaming
For recipes see "Boston Brown Bread," "Steamed Fig Pudding," "Poor Man's Pudding," "Christmas Plum Pudding," etc. Prepare and mix ingredients as directed. Put into greased molds and place in shallow pan of boiling water over very hot radiator in cooker. Fasten cover tight and cook for 5 to 6 hours.

Soups
Place ingredients in vessel; cover with cold water; bring to boil over free flame and boil 5 minutes. Fasten cover and transfer to cooker, using one hot radiator in bottom of well. Cook 3 or 4 hours and season when ready to serve.

For ingredients and special directions for preparing soups, see "Soups."

Roast Meats
Prepare and season meat in usual way. Place in large dry vessel; put very hot radiator in bottom of cooker well; place vessel containing roast on radiator, and place another very hot radiator on top. Close cooker and fasten. Allow it to remain about one-half hour per pound of meat.

The roast may be browned in a very hot oven before putting into cooker or just before serving.

Boiled or Stewed Meats
Prepare meat for cooking as usual, searing in frying pan if desired brown. Place in large vessel and cover or partly cover with boiling water, boiling with cover fastened tight for 10 or 15 minutes over free flame. Transfer to cooker, using one hot radiator underneath. Cook 2 or 3 hours, season and serve.

Vegetables
Prepare vegetables as usual. Place in vessel with small quantity of boiling water. As there is little evaporation in fireless cookers, allowance does not have to be made for loss by evaporation. Boil over free flame for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to cooker, using one radiator in bottom of well. Cook 3 or 4 hours, remove from cooker, season and serve.

Invalid Cookery
Always prepare food for the sick in the most careful and attractive manner. In sickness the senses are unusually acute and far more susceptible to carelessness and mistakes in the preparation and serving of food than in health.

Barley Water
2 tablespoons pearl barley
2 quarts cold water
Wash barley, soak several hours in cold water and boil gently in same water for 2 hours; or put into double boiler and cook for 4 hours or until reduced one-half. Lemon juice and sugar or salt to taste may be added if desired.

Pineapple Juice
Peel a very ripe pineapple, cut into small pieces and put through fruit press or potato ricer to extract all juice. Strain and serve with cracked ice.

[Pg 46]

Albuminized Orange
1 egg white
juice of 1 orange
sugar
Add orange juice sweetened to taste to egg white and beat well. Chill on ice and serve cold.

Beef Tea
1 pound lean beef
1 cup cold water
Cut beef up into small pieces or put through meat chopper. Put into fruit jar; add water and allow to stand 15 to 20 minutes to draw out the juice. Place on trivet or rack in pan of cold water; heat very slowly for about 2 hours. The water must not boil. Season, strain, cool and remove fat. Beef tea may be served hot or cold.

Scraped Beef
Scrape meat with sharp knife from lean beef cut from round until nothing but connective tissue is left. Form into small balls and broil slowly for about 2 minutes. Season and serve. For sandwiches do not cook but spread between thin slices of bread and season.

Spanish Cream
2 cups scalded milk
4 egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons granulated gelatine
1/4 cup cold water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pint cream
Pour scalded milk very slowly over egg yolks and sugar which have been mixed together. Cook slowly in double boiler until thick and smooth. Pour over gelatine which has been soaking in 1/4 cup of water. Chill, add vanilla and beat with egg whip until thick. Add the cream which has been whipped and chill in molds.

Gluten Muffins
2 cups gluten flour
3 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder
1 egg
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups milk
Sift together flour and baking powder; add beaten egg and melted butter to milk and add, Mix well and bake in greased muffin tins in moderate oven about 35 minutes.

In addition to the foregoing, many of the soups, broths, jellies, ices and plain drop cakes found in the preceding pages are suitable for invalids and convalescents.

Preserving and Canning
(Material adapted from U. S. Food Administration and N. Y. State Department of Agriculture.)

General Directions
Test all jars for leakage before using. To do this, fill with water, put on rubber and cover, seal and invert.

Sterilize all utensils, jars, covers, etc., by covering with cold water, and boil for 10 minutes. Use only new rubbers and dip in boiling water just before using.

Use a wide-mouthed funnel when filling jars to avoid loss of material and keep jar rim clean.

Invert all jars after filling and sealing.

Fruit should be sound, firm and not overripe. All fruit should be carefully prepared.

Clean fruit, clean hands, clean utensils, and a clean kitchen free from flies, are essential for safety and success.

Keep products in a cool place. Avoid freezing in winter.

Canning
Canning is the operation of preparing sterilized food so that it will keep indefinitely.

The custom of canning fruit in syrup is based on the improvement in flavor and texture which sugar gives to fruit. Sugar is not necessary for its preservation. Success depends upon thorough sterilizationâ€”that is, killing the organisms which cause food to spoil, and then sealing carefully to prevent their entrance. Fruit may be canned in water, in fruit juice and in syrup.

Preserving
The only difference between preserving and canning fruit is that sugar is always used in preserving, while in canning it is used in smaller quantity or not at all. In preserving the old rule of equal weights of sugar and fruit may be followed.

[Pg 47]

Directions for Canning by Open-Kettle Method
By this method which is generally used, for preserves, jams and marmalades, food is completely cooked and poured boiling hot into sterilized jars.

Prepare fruit, which may or may not be peeled, and cut into pieces depending on the variety. Blanch or scald peaches and similar fruits to loosen skin and chill by plunging into cold water. Cook slowly in as little water as possible or in fruit juice or fruit syrup until done. Fill the sterilized jars, seal and invert.

Directions for Canning by Can-Cooked Method
By this method uncooked or partly cooked food is packed in can or jar, covered with liquid and both jar and contents sterilized.

Pare fruit if desired or blanch or scald in boiling water a small quantity of the fruit at a time. (See time table.) Do not blanch cherries, sour cherries excepted, berries or plums.

Chill outside of the blanched fruit by immersing it for a few minutes in a vessel of cold water. Remove skin from such fruits as peaches.

Pack firmly in clean, tested jars to within one-half inch of top.

Fill jars to within 1/4 inch of top with boiling water, fruit juice, or syrup.

Place a new rubber on each jar, adjust cover and partly seal.

Place jars on false bottom of water bath and sterilize for required time. (See time-table.) If the hot-water bath is used, jars should be immersed in sufficient boiling water to cover tops to depth of about 1 inch. Do not begin to time the sterilizing until water boils. Keep water boiling during sterilizing period.

Remove jars from sterilizer. Seal them and invert to cool. Avoid a draft on jars, but cool as rapidly as possible.

Wash and label jars. Wrap in paper or store in a dark place to prevent loss of color of red fruit.

Vegetables may also be canned by this method.

A Time-Table for Canning Fruits by the Can-Cooked Method
TIME OF COOKING
Time of Blanching	If the hot-water bath is used	If the Pressure Cooker is used
(5 Pounds)
FRUIT	Minutes	Minutes	Minutes
Apricots, Peaches	1-2	16	10
Blackberries		16	6
Cherries, Strawberries, Grapes, Plums	16	10
Fruit Juices		20	10
Huckleberries, Raspberries		16	8
Pears	1-2	20	10
Pineapples		60	40
Quinces	1-2	60	40
Use of Sugar in Canning Fruit
Sugar is used in canning fruit for the purpose of improving flavor and is not necessary for preservation.

Thin syrupâ€”1 part sugar to 2 parts water for sweet fruits.

Medium Syrupâ€”1 part sugar to 1 part water for berries and medium sweet fruits.

Thick Syrupâ€”2 parts sugar to 1 part water for sour fruits.

To make syrup add sugar to boiling water. Stir until all sugar is dissolved, then boil 2 or 3 minutes.

Canned Peaches
Scald sound, firm freestone peaches, a small number at a time, in boiling water just long enough to loosen skins; dip them quickly into cold water and slip off skins. Cut peaches in halves, and remove stones. Have ready a syrup made by boiling sugar and water together until sugar has dissolved, using 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar to each cup water. Allow about 1 cup syrup for each quart jar of peaches. Put in 1 cracked peach pit for every quart of syrup.

Can-cooked Method.â€”Pack peaches in overlapping layers with rounded side uppermost and blossom end facing glass. Fill each jar with hot syrup and adjust rubber, cover and upper clamp, thus partly sealing jar. Place jars on a rack in hot water to cover tops to a depth of 1 inch. Bring water to boiling point, and boil pint jars 16 minutes, quart jars 20 minutes. Remove jars, seal and invert to cool.

[Pg 48]

Open-kettle Method.â€”Cook peaches in syrup until tender; then with sterilized spoon slip them carefully into sterilized jar; fill jar to overflowing with syrup. Adjust rubber, cover, seal immediately, and invert to cool.

Canned Cherries
Wash. Cherries should be pitted before being canned in order to conserve space. Can sweet cherries as berries. Blanch sour cherries 1/2 minute, in boiling water. Dip in cold water; drain and pack closely into hot sterilized jars. Cover with boiling water or boiling medium syrup. Loosely seal. Sterilize 16 minutes in boiling water bath. Remove jars at once, tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.

Canned Pears
Wash and peel fruit and follow directions for canned peaches.

Canned Berries
Blackberries, blueberries, huckleberries, raspberries, loganberries, gooseberries and strawberries should be canned as soon as possible after picking. Hull or stem; place in strainer and wash by lifting up and down in pan of cold water.

Pack into hot sterilized glass jars, using care not to crush fruit. To insure a close pack, put a 2 or 3 inch layer of berries on the bottom of jar and press down gently with spoon. Continue in this manner until jar is filled. Boiling water or boiling thin or medium syrup should be poured over the fruit at once. Loosely seal. Sterilize 16 minutes in boiling water. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.

Asparagus
Asparagus for canning must be fresh and tender. Select tips of uniform size and maturity and wash. Cut into lengths according to containers to be used. Scrape off scales, tough outer skins and hard ends and tie in bundles large enough for one jar.

Immerse the lower ends in boiling water and leave them immersed for 5 minutes, then the entire stalks, leaving them in 1 to 3 minutes longer.

Cold dip, drain, pack neatly, tips up, in hot sterilized jars. Add salt and cover with boiling water. Loosely seal, sterilize two hours in boiling water bath. Remove as soon as time is up. Tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.

Beans
Green String Beans and Wax Beans.â€”The beans should be tender and fresh, and graded according to size and washed. Leave whole or break in uniform pieces. Blanch 5 to 10 minutes until the pod will bend without breaking. Cold dip, drain well and pack into hot jars. Add salt and cover with boiling water. Loosely seal and sterilize two hours in boiling water. Remove when time is up, tighten covers, and invert to test seal.

Corn
Make careful selection of tender, juicy sweet corn, at best stage for table use. Can as soon as possible after gathering. Remove husks and silk; blanch tender ears 5 minutes, older ears 10 minutes. Cold dip and cut from cob but not too close. Pack at once into hot sterilized jars. As corn swells during sterilization, leave space of 1 inch at top. Add salt and cover with boiling water. Be sure that water penetrates through corn to the bottom of jar. Loosely seal and sterilize three hours in boiling water. Remove when time is up, tighten covers, invert to test seal and cool.

Jams
Jams are usually made with small fruits or with chopped large fruits. Cook slowly with an equal weight of sugar until thick; put into sterilized tumblers or jars and seal.

Raspberry Jam
Pick over berries. Mash a few in bottom of preserving kettle; continue until fruit is used. Heat slowly to boiling point and add equal quantity of heated sugar. Cook slowly 45 minutes. Put into sterilized jars.

Blackberry, gooseberry or other berry jam may be made in this way.

[Pg 49]

Jellies
Heat and mash fruit until juice runs readily. If fruit is not entirely broken up rub through coarse sieve. Pour into sterilized jelly bags of unbleached muslin or doubled cheesecloth and drain thoroughly but do not squeeze. Take 7/8 cup sugar for each cup of juice. Boil juice 8 to 20 minutes (berries and currants less than other fruits); add sugar which has been heated in oven; stir until sugar is dissolved and boil about 5 minutes. Pour into hot sterilized tumblers. Hard fruits like apples and quinces should be cut up, covered with cold water and cooked until tender before turning into jelly bags.

Keep the Home Baking Safeguarded
Housekeepers who have always used Royal Baking Powder with utmost satisfaction are sometimes misled into experimenting with baking powders containing questionable ingredients.

No real economy is thus accomplishedâ€”in fact, the use of an unwholesome, undependable baking powder often produces a bitter taste in the food which makes it unappetizing and sometimes inedible, to say nothing of the injurious effect produced upon the digestive system.

Royal Baking Powder is most economical. Its well-known dependability makes baking success simpler and surer, thus preventing loss of eggs, flour, butter and other ingredients. Only the best materials are used in its productionâ€”pure cream of tartar and tartaric acid, derived from grapes, bicarbonate of soda and corn starch, all scientifically blended and perfectly balanced. The best is always the most economical.

To insure food that is always delicious, wholesome and appetizing, insist on using Royal Baking Powder which is made from Cream of Tartar, derived from grapes.

[Pg 51]

BAKE IT WITH ROYAL AND BE SURE
has been the motto for fifty years in millions of homes where good food is recognized as the first essential of good health and where pride is taken in good baking.

One of the distinctive qualities of food baked with Royal Baking Powder is wholesomeness.

This is health insurance of such vital importance that millions of women bake at home just to be sure that Royal Baking Powder is used.

Remember the adageâ€”

"Bake it with Royal and be sure."

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

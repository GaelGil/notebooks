## What I Did
In this project I trained on a turicreate model to sneaker images. These snearkers are jordan 1, jordan 3, jordan 4 and jordan 11. To read more about the model and what I created here is the link to the jupyter notebook. 


## Testing it out
To test it out on your own images you can add your own images to testImages with the names of the images as jordan_#.png. Once you have your images you can run:

~~~python3

python3 classifyImg.py

~~~

This will print out the name of the imgage and the class it has predicted.
